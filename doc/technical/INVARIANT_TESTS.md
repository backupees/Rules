# Invariant Tests

[TOC]

This document describes the **stateful invariant suite** in [`test/invariant/`](../../test/invariant/) — what each invariant asserts, why it matters, how the handlers are built, and how the suite was verified to actually catch bugs.

Invariant tests differ from the unit and fuzz tests elsewhere in `test/`: instead of exercising a fixed call sequence, Foundry drives a **handler** contract with long, randomly-ordered sequences of calls and re-checks every `invariant_*` function after each step. They are the right tool for the two **stateful (operation) rules**, whose storage evolves across calls.

Validation rules are read-only and hold no per-transfer state, so they have nothing to conserve across a call sequence — they are covered by unit and fuzz tests instead.

---

## 1. Running the suite

```bash
forge test --match-path "test/invariant/*"          # the invariant suite only
forge test --match-contract ConditionalTransferInvariants
forge test --match-contract MintAllowanceInvariants
forge test                                          # everything, invariants included
```

Configuration lives in `foundry.toml`:

```toml
[invariant]
runs = 64             # independent random sequences
depth = 128           # calls per sequence
fail_on_revert = true # a reverting handler call fails the run
```

`runs × depth` ⇒ **8 192 handler calls per invariant**. `fail_on_revert = true` is deliberate: the handlers are written to only ever make calls the rule will accept, so **any** revert means the handler (or the rule) is wrong, and we want to know. The suite currently reports **0 reverts**.

---

## 2. Architecture — the handler pattern

Foundry cannot usefully fuzz a rule directly: `approveTransfer` needs `OPERATOR_ROLE`, `transferred` may only be called by the bound entity, and random inputs would mostly revert. So each rule gets a **handler** that:

1. **Holds the required roles and is itself the bound entity.** The handler is passed to `bindToken(address(handler))` and granted the operator role, so `msg.sender` inside the rule is the handler and every call is authorized.
2. **Bounds the inputs.** A small actor set (3 addresses) and a small value range make the fuzzer *collide* on the same keys repeatedly, which is what actually exercises the accounting.
3. **Skips calls that would revert** (e.g. cancelling a non-existent approval), so `fail_on_revert = true` stays meaningful.
4. **Maintains ghost variables** — an independent, off-chain-style mirror of what the rule's state *should* be. The invariant then compares the rule against the ghost.

```

        └──────────────────────┘                          └────────┘  └────────────┘
```

`targetSelector` restricts the fuzzer to the handler's own action functions. Without it, Foundry would also call the public functions the handler inherits from forge-std's `Test`, wasting the call budget.

## 3. The invariants

### 3.1 `RuleConditionalTransferLight` — approval conservation

Handler actions: `approve` · `cancel` · `execute` · `executeMintOrBurn`.
Ghosts: `totalApproved`, `totalCancelled`, `totalExecuted`, `mintBurnCalls`.

#### `invariant_approvalConservation`

```
totalApproved − totalCancelled − totalExecuted  ==  Σ approvalCounts
```

Every approval ever recorded is, at any moment, in exactly one of three states: **still outstanding**, **cancelled**, or **consumed by a transfer**. The equality says approvals are neither **double-spent** (one `approveTransfer` consumed twice) nor **lost** (an approval that vanishes without being cancelled or used).

The invariant additionally asserts `totalApproved >= totalCancelled + totalExecuted`, which fails loudly if the rule ever lets more approvals be consumed than were recorded — i.e. an underflow of `approvalCounts` (`INV-5`).

#### `invariant_noApprovalExceedsTotalRecorded`

```
Σ approvalCounts  ≤  totalApproved
```

A weaker but independent bound: no tuple can ever hold more outstanding approvals than were granted in total. It catches a class of bug (spurious increments) that conservation alone could mask if a matching spurious decrement existed.

#### Emergent property — mint/burn never consume an approval

The handler calls `executeMintOrBurn`, firing `transferred(address(0), to, v)` and `transferred(from, address(0), v)`, but **deliberately does not** count these in `totalExecuted`. If a mint or burn ever consumed an approval, `Σ approvalCounts` would drop while `totalExecuted` stayed put, and `invariant_approvalConservation` would break.

So the mint/burn exemption is proved by the conservation invariant itself — no separate test needed.

### 3.2 `RuleMintAllowance` — exact quota accounting

Handler actions: `setAllowance` · `increase` · `decrease` · `mint` · `regularTransfer`.
Ghosts: `ghostAllowance[minter]` (a full mirror), `totalCredited`, `totalMinted`.

#### `invariant_allowanceMatchesGhost`

```
for every minter m:   rule.mintAllowance(m)  ==  ghostAllowance[m]
```

The strongest of the four. The handler recomputes the expected allowance independently after every accepted operation, so this asserts the rule's arithmetic is **exactly** right after *any* interleaving of set / increase / decrease / mint. It subsumes "never underflows" and "monotonically non-increasing across mints" (`INV-7`).

#### `invariant_mintedNeverExceedsCredited`

```
Σ minted  ≤  Σ credited
```

A cumulative safety bound independent of the mirror: across the whole run, minters can never mint more in total than was ever granted to them, regardless of how quotas were reset or adjusted along the way.

#### Emergent property — non-mint transfers never touch a quota

The handler calls `regularTransfer` (a `transferred(spender, from ≠ 0, to, v)` call) and **deliberately leaves the ghost unchanged**. If the rule ever deducted quota on a non-mint path, the mirror would diverge and `invariant_allowanceMatchesGhost` would fail.

---

## 4. Negative controls — proving the suite can fail

An invariant suite that cannot fail is worthless. Both invariants were **mutation-tested**: a real bug was injected into the rule, the suite was run, and the failure was confirmed. The mutations were then reverted.

| Mutation | Injected bug | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `RuleConditionalTransferLightApprovalBase._transferred` — remove `approvalCounts[hash] = count - 1` | Approval **double-spend**: one approval can be consumed forever | ❌ `invariant_approvalConservation` fails: `approval accounting drifted: 0 != 1` |
| `RuleMintAllowanceBase._transferredFrom` — `current - value` → `current - value + 1` | **Off-by-one** quota deduction: minters slowly gain free quota | ❌ `invariant_allowanceMatchesGhost` fails: `mint allowance drifted from expected: 1938542 != 1938541` |

Re-run these yourself before trusting a change to either rule: if you mutate the accounting and the suite still passes, the suite has regressed.

## 5. Coverage map

Invariant IDs refer to [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](../../THREAT_MODEL.md) §8; verification status is tracked in [`RESULT.md`](../../RESULT.md).

| Invariant (threat model) | Property | Covered by |
|---|---|---|
| `INV-5` | `approvalCounts` never underflows; one approval ⇒ one transfer | `invariant_approvalConservation`, `invariant_noApprovalExceedsTotalRecorded` |
| `INV-7` | `mintAllowance` non-increasing across mints, never underflows, `Σ minted ≤ Σ granted` | `invariant_allowanceMatchesGhost`, `invariant_mintedNeverExceedsCredited` |
| `INV-12` (partial) | Mint/burn handled explicitly, never falling into the transfer path | Emergent from both suites (see §3.1, §3.2) |

**Not covered by invariants (by design):**

- `INV-1`, `INV-2`, `INV-3`, `INV-9` — properties of *stateless* view functions; unit and fuzz tests are the right tool (`test/ThreatModel/ThreatModelTests.t.sol`).
- `INV-6` (`_transferHash` injectivity) — a pure function; covered by `testFuzz_HASH1_ApprovalBucketsAreDistinct`.
- `INV-4`, `INV-11` (access control) — covered by the per-rule access-control suites.
- `INV-10` (ERC-2771 binding identity) — currently holds by static reasoning; a live regression test is the open item **I-10a** in [`RULE_IMPROVEMENT.md`](../../RULE_IMPROVEMENT.md).

## 6. Adding a new invariant

1. Add the action to the relevant handler. **Guard it** so it can only make calls the rule accepts (`fail_on_revert = true` will otherwise fail the run).
2. Update the ghost state *after* the rule call, in the same function. If the rule call reverts, the whole handler call reverts and the ghost rolls back with it — which is what keeps the mirror consistent.
3. Register the new selector in the `targetSelector(...)` array in `RuleInvariants.t.sol`, otherwise it will never be fuzzed.
4. Add the `invariant_*` function, with a message argument on each assertion so a failure is legible.
5. **Mutation-test it.** Inject the bug it is supposed to catch and confirm it fails.

If you add a new stateful rule, it needs its own handler; validation rules do not.
