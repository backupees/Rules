# Rule Semantics — comparison table

[TOC]

The rules in this library answer the same two questions — *may this transfer proceed?* (read path) and *record/enforce it* (write path) — but they answer with **different conventions**. In particular they differ on **whether they screen the spender**, **how they treat mint (`from == address(0)`) and burn (`to == address(0)`)**, and **what happens when their external oracle/registry is unset**. This page is the single place those differences are laid out side by side so an integrator does not have to read each rule's source to learn them.

Each cell reflects the rule's own `_detectTransferRestriction*` logic; behaviour is identical on the enforcement path (`transferred`), which reverts on any non-`TRANSFER_OK` code.

## 1. Who each rule screens

"Direct" = a plain `transfer` (`transferred(from, to, value)`). The spender columns apply to the 4-arg `transferred(spender, from, to, value)` path; **mint** is that path with `from == address(0)` and `spender == minter`, **burn** with `to == address(0)` and `spender == burner` (CMTAT v3.3+).

## 3. Overload surface (ERC-7943 `tokenId` / `ITransferContext`)

Not every rule exposes the same entrypoints. The ERC-7943 `tokenId` overloads and the `ITransferContext` struct entrypoints come from `RuleNFTAdapter`, and **only the rules that inherit it have them**. The omission is deliberate: `RuleMaxTotalSupply` and `RuleChainlinkPoR` cap a fungible supply, and the conditional-transfer / mint-allowance rules key on fungible amounts, so a `tokenId` dimension would be meaningless for them.

| Rule | ERC-7943 `tokenId` overloads [12] | `transferred(FungibleTransferContext)` | `transferred(MultiTokenTransferContext)` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RuleWhitelist` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `RuleWhitelistWrapper` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `RuleReceiverWhitelist` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `RuleBlacklist` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `RuleSpenderWhitelist` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `RuleSanctionsList` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `RuleERC2980` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `RuleIdentityRegistry` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `RuleMaxTotalSupply` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `RuleChainlinkPoR` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `RuleConditionalTransferLight` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `RuleConditionalTransferLightMultiToken` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `RuleMintAllowance` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

The `tokenId` parameter is **always ignored** by the rules that accept it — `RuleNFTAdapter` exists purely to re-expose the same restriction logic under the ERC-7943 signatures. The `tokenId` overload of any function therefore returns exactly what its fungible counterpart returns, and the `ctx` entrypoints dispatch to the same internal hooks (`ctx.sender == 0` or `ctx.sender == ctx.from` ⇒ the direct hook; otherwise the spender-aware hook). This parity is asserted for every rule above in `test/TransferContext/OverloadParity.t.sol`.

**Access control on the `ctx` entrypoints (threat `AC-5`).** `transferred(FungibleTransferContext)` / `transferred(MultiTokenTransferContext)` are `external` with **no caller restriction** on the validation rules. That is safe because those rules' hooks are `view`: an arbitrary caller can run the check and be reverted by it, but cannot mutate any state. The stateful multi-token rule guards its own `ctx` entrypoint with `onlyTransferExecutor`.

## 4. Notes & caveats

> **Mint/burn permission is an explicit flag, never `address(0)` list membership.** `RuleWhitelist`, `RuleWhitelistWrapper` and `RuleERC2980` each expose `allowMint` / `allowBurn` — set together by the `allowMintBurn` constructor parameter, then independently settable via `setAllowMint` / `setAllowBurn` (e.g. to permanently close issuance while keeping redemptions open). The zero address can **never** enter any list (single adds revert, batch adds skip it), so the standardized getters stay truthful: `isVerified(address(0))` and `whitelist(address(0))` are always `false`, as ERC-3643 and ERC-2980 require. A blocked mint returns a dedicated code (`24` for the whitelist rules, `64` for ERC-2980) rather than the misleading "sender not whitelisted". The flag gates the **operation only**: a permitted mint still requires a whitelisted *recipient*, and a permitted burn a whitelisted *sender*.


1. **Deny-lists intentionally screen the minter/burner.** `RuleBlacklist` and `RuleSanctionsList` do **not** exempt mint/burn from the spender check, so a blacklisted/sanctioned address cannot mint or burn. This is correct fail-closed behaviour for a deny-list (threat `BL-1`), the mirror image of the whitelist rules, which exempt mint/burn because the minter acts on its own authority rather than as a delegated spender.

1b. **`RuleReceiverWhitelist` screens the receiver and nothing else** — the CMTAT-side expression of ERC-3643's eligibility rule. The sender and the spender are never checked, deliberately: screening the sender **traps de-listed holders**, and ERC-3643 checks only the receiver precisely so a lapsed investor can still exit. Mint is screened on the receiver like any other transfer (no `allowMint` flag); burn is exempt, because `address(0)` can never be listed and would otherwise be rejected on every burn. Equivalence with the standard is pinned against the real vendored token in `test/ERC3643Real/ERC3643ReceiverWhitelistParity.t.sol`. Use `RuleWhitelist` when you want both parties screened. See [RuleReceiverWhitelist.md](../contracts/RuleReceiverWhitelist.md).

2. **`RuleMaxTotalSupply` only acts on mints.** `_detectTransferRestriction` returns `TRANSFER_OK` unless `from == address(0)`; it caps *total supply*, so the "screened party" is the mint operation, not any address. The spender is ignored on every path.

2b. **`RuleChainlinkPoR` only acts on mints, and fails closed for mints only.** Like `RuleMaxTotalSupply` it returns `TRANSFER_OK` unless `from == address(0)`, and ignores the spender. The cap is not static but read live from a Chainlink Proof of Reserve feed: `totalSupply + value` must stay within the reported reserves, scaled from the feed's decimals to the token's. The limit equals the reserves exactly — there is no margin parameter. Feed failures are reported by kind: code `79` when no usable response could be obtained (`decimals()` or `latestRoundData()` reverted, or the feed reports more than `MAX_FEED_DECIMALS`), code `77` when a round was returned but is unusable (negative reserve, incomplete round), and code `76` when the answer is older than `maxStalenessSeconds`. A `tokenContract` whose `totalSupply()` reverts yields code `78`. **One instance protects one token:** the rule reads `totalSupply()` from its configured `tokenContract`, not from the token that triggered the check, so sharing an instance across two RuleEngines silently evaluates both against the first token's supply and feed (same exposure as `RuleMaxTotalSupply`; see [One instance per protected token](../contracts/RuleChainlinkPoR.md#one-instance-per-protected-token)). Both block **minting only** — transfers and burns still pass, so a lapsed feed never traps holders. The read path is guarded (`code.length` check, `try/catch`, saturating arithmetic) so it can return these codes without reverting. See [RuleChainlinkPoR.md](../contracts/RuleChainlinkPoR.md).

3. **`RuleIdentityRegistry` is ERC-3643 conformant: only the RECEIVER is verified** (improvement I-1, finding **F-1** fixed). The spec mandates exactly one check — *"The receiver MUST be whitelisted on the Identity Registry and verified"* — and explicitly states that `transferFrom` "works the same way", that `mint` "only require[s] the receiver", and that `burn` "bypasses all checks on eligibility". The sender, spender and minter are therefore **not** screened by default. Checking the sender would **trap de-listed holders**: ERC-3643 screens only the receiver precisely so an investor whose identity lapses can still exit their position by sending to a verified counterparty. Stricter screening is available as an explicit opt-in via `checkSender` / `checkSpender` (both default `false`); mint and burn stay exempt from the spender check even when `checkSpender` is on.

4. **`RuleERC2980` does not require the sender to be whitelisted** — only that the sender is *not frozen*; only the recipient must be whitelisted (threat `E29-1`, ERC-2980 semantics). Note also that freezing `address(0)` blocks all mints and that burns require `address(0)` to be whitelisted via the `allowBurn` constructor flag (threat `E29-2`).

5. **Conditional-transfer rules screen the (from, to, value) tuple, not identities.** A transfer is allowed iff an operator has recorded an approval for that exact tuple; the individual addresses are never checked against a list. Mint/burn are exempt (`from`/`to == address(0)` returns early).

6. **`RuleMintAllowance` is the only rule that *uses* the mint spender.** On the 4-arg path with `from == address(0)`, it debits `mintAllowance[spender]`. On the 3-arg path (no spender) it performs no deduction, so it must be deployed against the CMTAT/RuleEngine v3.3+ spender-aware path.

7. **Stateful** means the rule writes storage inside the `transferred` callback. Validation rules are read-only; the three operation rules (`RuleConditionalTransferLight`, `…MultiToken`, `RuleMintAllowance`) mutate state and require `bindToken`.

8. **Fail-open when unset.** `RuleSanctionsList` (oracle == `address(0)`) and `RuleIdentityRegistry` (registry == `address(0)`) return `TRANSFER_OK` for everything — screening is disabled, not fail-closed (threats `SL-1`/`SL-2`). `clearSanctionListOracle()` / `clearIdentityRegistry()` are single-call kill switches for that screening. Compose with another rule if a hard floor is required.

9. **`RuleMaxTotalSupply` views are overflow-safe** (finding **F-2**, fixed): `detectTransferRestriction` / `canTransfer` return code `50` instead of reverting when `currentSupply + value` would overflow.

10. **`RuleConditionalTransferLightMultiToken` is direct-binding-only, and its `detectTransferRestriction` depends on `msg.sender`.** Approvals are recorded under the `token` argument but *consumed* under `msg.sender`, so the rule **must be bound directly to each token** (`CMTAT.setRuleEngine(rule)`) and **must not be added to a `RuleEngine`** — behind an engine it either reverts or silently loses all per-token isolation (finding **F-4**; full case analysis in [RuleConditionalTransferLightMultiToken.md](../contracts/RuleConditionalTransferLightMultiToken.md#deployment-topology--why-a-ruleengine-does-not-work)). For the same reason `detectTransferRestriction` / `canTransfer` derive the token key from the caller, so an off-chain `eth_call` from a non-bound address always reads "not approved" (code 46) even for an approved transfer (threat `CTL-4`, finding **F-8**). Use the caller-explicit **`detectTransferRestrictionForToken(token, …)`** / **`canTransferForToken(token, …)`** views for pre-flight — they take the token as a parameter and give every caller the real answer.

11. **`RuleMintAllowance.canTransfer` / `detectTransferRestriction` are NOT authoritative** (finding **F-7**): they are hardcoded to "allowed" because the 3-arg signature has no minter identity. Pre-flight a mint with `canTransferFrom(minter, address(0), to, value)`. See [RuleMintAllowance.md](../contracts/RuleMintAllowance.md#eligibility-views-which-one-is-authoritative).

12. **The ERC-7943 `tokenId` overloads** are `detectTransferRestriction(from,to,tokenId,value)`, `detectTransferRestrictionFrom(spender,from,to,tokenId,value)`, `canTransfer(from,to,tokenId,amount)`, `canTransferFrom(spender,from,to,tokenId,value)`, `transferred(from,to,tokenId,value)` and `transferred(spender,from,to,tokenId,value)` — all supplied by `RuleNFTAdapter`. Per ERC-7943, `amount`/`value` MUST be `1` for ERC-721. The rules ignore `tokenId` entirely; it exists so an ERC-721/ERC-1155 token can call the same compliance rule without a shim.
