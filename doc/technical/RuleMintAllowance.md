# Rule Mint Allowance

[TOC]

This rule enforces a per-minter mint quota. An operator assigns each minter address a maximum number of tokens it is allowed to mint. Every successful mint reduces the minter's remaining allowance. The operator can adjust the allowance at any time by setting an absolute value or by incrementing/decrementing the current one.

It is an **operation rule**: it modifies state during the transfer call (deducting from the minter's allowance), unlike validation rules which are read-only.

Regular transfers and burns are **not restricted** by this rule — it only acts on minting operations (`from == address(0)`).

`detectTransferRestriction(from, to, value)` (the 3-arg form without a spender) always returns `TRANSFER_OK` because the minter's identity is not available in that call path. Use `detectTransferRestrictionFrom(minter, address(0), to, amount)` to query a minter's allowance.

> Compatibility warning: this rule does **not** enforce mint allowances for a token that only calls the standard ERC-3643 3-arg compliance functions. It requires the spender-aware RuleEngine/CMTAT v3.3+ path (`detectTransferRestrictionFrom` and `transferred(spender, from, to, value)`) so the minter address is available.

## Restriction codes

| Constant | Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CODE_MINTER_ALLOWANCE_EXCEEDED` | 70 | Minter's remaining allowance is less than the requested mint amount |

## Access Control

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Manages all roles; implicitly holds all roles below |
| `ALLOWANCE_OPERATOR_ROLE` | May set, increase, and decrease per-minter allowances |
| `COMPLIANCE_MANAGER_ROLE` | May bind and unbind the rule to a RuleEngine (`bindToken`, `unbindToken`) |

The state-modifying `transferred()` functions are restricted to the bound entity only. In the standard CMTAT + RuleEngine deployment, bind the rule to the **RuleEngine address** (not the token address), because the RuleEngine is the direct caller of the rule's `transferred()`. The rule targets exactly one bound entity at a time; attempting to bind a second RuleEngine/token reverts with `RuleMintAllowance_TokenAlreadyBound`. To migrate, call `unbindToken` first.

## Methods

### `setMintAllowance(address minter, uint256 amount)`

Sets the `minter`'s allowance to an absolute `amount`, overwriting any previous value. Restricted to `ALLOWANCE_OPERATOR_ROLE`. Emits `MintAllowanceSet`.

### `increaseMintAllowance(address minter, uint256 amount)`

Adds `amount` to `minter`'s current allowance. Restricted to `ALLOWANCE_OPERATOR_ROLE`. Emits `MintAllowanceIncreased`.

### `decreaseMintAllowance(address minter, uint256 amount)`

Subtracts `amount` from `minter`'s current allowance. Reverts with `RuleMintAllowance_DecreaseBelowZero` if `amount` exceeds the current allowance. Restricted to `ALLOWANCE_OPERATOR_ROLE`. Emits `MintAllowanceDecreased`.

### `mintAllowance(address minter) → uint256`

Returns the remaining mint allowance for `minter`. Default is `0`.

### `bindToken(address token)` / `unbindToken(address token)`

Binds or unbinds the caller address. Only the bound address is authorised to call `transferred`. In practice, bind the RuleEngine address. Restricted to `COMPLIANCE_MANAGER_ROLE`. A second `bindToken` call reverts until the current binding is removed.

## Workflow

1. Deploy `RuleMintAllowance` (or `RuleMintAllowanceOwnable2Step`).
2. Add the rule to the RuleEngine with `ruleEngine.addRule(ruleMintAllowance)`.
3. Bind the rule to the RuleEngine: `ruleMintAllowance.bindToken(address(ruleEngine))`.
4. Set the CMTAT's RuleEngine: `cmtat.setRuleEngine(ruleEngine)`.
5. For each minter, call `setMintAllowance(minterAddress, quota)`.
6. Minters can now mint tokens up to their assigned quota.

## Allowance deduction

When CMTAT v3.3+ calls `ruleEngine.transferred(minter, address(0), recipient, amount)`, the rule receives `transferred(minter, address(0), recipient, amount)` and deducts `amount` from `mintAllowance[minter]`. If `amount > mintAllowance[minter]`, the call reverts with `RuleMintAllowance_AllowanceExceeded`.

## Multiple minters

Each minter has an independent allowance within the single bound RuleEngine/token. Multiple minters can share a single `RuleMintAllowance` instance, but that instance intentionally targets only one bound caller at a time so allowance state is not shared across multiple RuleEngines/tokens.

## Notes

### 3-arg `transferred` path

When CMTAT calls `ruleEngine.transferred(from, to, value)` without a spender (CMTAT v3.2 and earlier, a pure ERC-3643 token, or when spender is `address(0)`), the rule receives the 3-arg call and performs **no deduction**. The minter's quota is only consumed via the 4-arg path where the minter's address is passed as `spender`.

Because of this, `RuleMintAllowance` must not be used as a standalone compliance contract for a pure ERC-3643 token. It is intended for the CMTAT/RuleEngine spender-aware integration path.

### Burns not restricted

Burns (`to == address(0)`) are not tracked by this rule. Minters do not recover allowance when tokens are burned.

## Usage scenario

An issuer deploys `RuleMintAllowance` and grants `ALLOWANCE_OPERATOR_ROLE` to a compliance officer. The officer assigns `setMintAllowance(alice, 100_000e18)` — Alice may mint up to 100 000 tokens. Each `cmtat.mint(recipient, amount)` call by Alice reduces her quota. Once exhausted, further mints by Alice revert. The officer can call `increaseMintAllowance(alice, 50_000e18)` to extend Alice's quota or `setMintAllowance(alice, 0)` to revoke it entirely.
