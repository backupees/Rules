# Rule Max Balance

[TOC]

`RuleMaxBalance` caps how many tokens a single address may hold. One cap applies to every holder, and the
operator may exempt specific addresses from it.

The rule screens the **receiver**: a transfer is rejected when `balanceOf(to) + value > maxBalance`. Mints are
covered by the same check, since a mint raises the receiver's balance exactly as a transfer does.

> ## ⚠️ Do not deploy this rule on its own

> **The cap counts tokens per *address*, not per investor.** That is the only thing a compliance contract can
> observe on-chain. An investor who wants more than `maxBalance` simply splits the position across two
> addresses, and no rule objects, because each address is individually under the cap.
>
> **Pair it with a rule that admits one address per investor:**
>
> | Rule | What it contributes |
> | --- | --- |
> | [`RuleWhitelist`](./RuleWhitelist.md) | Only admitted addresses may send or receive |
> | [`RuleReceiverWhitelist`](./RuleReceiverWhitelist.md) | Only admitted addresses may receive (ERC-3643 eligibility semantics) |
> | [`RuleIdentityRegistry`](./RuleIdentityRegistry.md) | Only identity-verified addresses may receive |
>
> **The pairing is necessary but not sufficient — the operator policy is what closes the gap.** A whitelist
> admits *addresses*. If the operator admits two wallets belonging to the same investor, the cap is doubled
> again. The property you actually need is **one admitted address per legal entity**, enforced off-chain
> during onboarding and reflected on-chain by admitting exactly one address per investor.
>
> This is pinned by
> [`testSplitWalletsBypassTheCapEvenWithAWhitelist`](../../../test/RuleMaxBalance/RuleMaxBalanceCMTATIntegration.t.sol),
> which deliberately admits both wallets of one investor and shows the combined holding reaching twice the cap
> with a whitelist active. If that test ever fails, the bypass has been closed by other means and this warning
> should be revisited.

## Restriction codes

| Constant | Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CODE_MAX_BALANCE_EXCEEDED` | 82 | The transfer would push the receiver's balance above `maxBalance` |
| `CODE_BALANCE_UNAVAILABLE` | 83 | `balanceOf(to)` could not be read, so the cap cannot be verified |

## Who is screened

| Operation | Screened? |
| --- | --- |
| Transfer / `transferFrom` | **Receiver only** |
| Mint (`from == address(0)`) | **Receiver** — a mint raises a balance like any transfer |
| Burn (`to == address(0)`) | **No** — reducing supply cannot breach a maximum |
| Sender | **Never** — sending tokens away only lowers a balance |
| Spender on `transferFrom` | **Never** — the cap constrains who *ends up holding*, not who moved the tokens |

An address already above the cap keeps its tokens and may still send them away. It simply cannot receive more
until it is back under the cap. The same is true after the operator lowers the cap: existing balances are not
clawed back.

## Configuration

| Constructor parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `admin` / `owner` | Receives `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, or ownership in the `Ownable2Step` variant |
| `balanceToken_` | Token whose `balanceOf` is read; must be a contract answering `balanceOf` |
| `maxBalance_` | Maximum balance per non-exempt address |

### `maxBalance` has no magic value

`0` means non-exempt addresses may hold **nothing**; it does **not** disable the rule. This is deliberate: a
sentinel meaning "unlimited" would turn an operator's attempt to freeze holdings into the opposite. To lift the
cap, set `type(uint256).max` or remove the rule from the engine.

## Methods

| Function | Role required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setMaxBalance(uint256)` | `MAX_BALANCE_ROLE` / owner | Updates the cap |
| `setBalanceToken(address)` | `MAX_BALANCE_ROLE` / owner | Updates the observed token |
| `addExemptAddress(address)` | `MAX_BALANCE_ROLE` / owner | Exempts one address; reverts if already exempt or zero |
| `removeExemptAddress(address)` | `MAX_BALANCE_ROLE` / owner | Removes one exemption; reverts if not exempt |
| `addExemptAddresses(address[])` | `MAX_BALANCE_ROLE` / owner | Batch exempt; duplicates skipped, `address(0)` rejects the whole batch |
| `removeExemptAddresses(address[])` | `MAX_BALANCE_ROLE` / owner | Batch remove; unknown entries skipped |
| `isExemptAddress(address) → bool` | — | Whether an address may hold any amount |
| `exemptAddressCount() → uint256` | — | Number of exempt addresses |
| `remainingCapacity(address) → (uint8, uint256)` | — | Headroom before the cap, without simulating a transfer |

Exemptions reuse the same `EnumerableSet` machinery as `RuleWhitelist` (`RuleAddressSetInternal`), so the batch
semantics match the rest of the library: duplicates are skipped and counted, while `address(0)` is rejected on
every add path including batches (invariant I-12).

### Typical exemptions

The exemption list exists for addresses that are not investor positions: the issuer's treasury, a custodian or
omnibus account holding on behalf of many investors, a redemption or escrow contract, or a DEX pool. Exempting
a custodian is the usual case — it holds for many people, so a per-holder cap is meaningless for it.

> ⚠️ **An exempt address is an unlimited-holding address.** If the reason for the cap is a regulatory
> concentration limit, exempting an account is a policy decision, not a technical convenience.

## The read path never reverts

The ERC-1404 / ERC-3643 views MUST NOT revert, so `balanceOf` is wrapped in `try/catch` and a failure yields
`CODE_BALANCE_UNAVAILABLE` (fail-closed: the transfer is blocked rather than assumed safe). The token is
validated at configuration — non-zero, has code, `balanceOf` callable — so reaching that branch means the token
changed behaviour after configuration, for example a proxy upgraded to something that reverts, or a pausable
implementation reverting while paused.

Burns and exempt receivers are decided before any balance is read, so they keep working even while the token is
unreadable.

As with `RuleMaxTotalSupply` and `RuleChainlinkPoR`, this relies on the configured token still having code: a
`try` call to a codeless address reverts *uncatchably*. The setter requires code, and EIP-6780 (Cancun) makes
that permanent. This is a **deployment precondition** — a Cancun-or-later chain, which `foundry.toml` targets.

## One instance per protected token

The rule reads balances from the `balanceToken` it was configured with, never from the token that triggered the
check, and behind a RuleEngine it cannot learn that identity. Adding one instance to two RuleEngines would
evaluate both tokens against the first one's balances. Deploy a second instance instead. This is the same
exposure as `RuleMaxTotalSupply` and `RuleChainlinkPoR`.

## Usage scenario

An issuer must keep any single investor below 5% of a 1,000,000-token issue. They deploy `RuleWhitelist` and
`RuleMaxBalance(admin, cmtat, 50_000)` in the same RuleEngine, admit exactly one address per onboarded
investor, and exempt the treasury address that holds the unsold allocation. An investor at 50,000 tokens can
still sell, and can buy again once below the cap; a mint that would push them over is rejected with code `82`.
