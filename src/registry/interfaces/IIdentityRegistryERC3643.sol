 * `updateIdentity`, `updateCountry`, `batchRegisterIdentity`, `identityStorage`, `issuersRegistry`
 * and `topicsRegistry`. **None of those are invoked by `Token.sol`**, so they are deliberately left
 * out here: a registry that implements only this interface is a complete drop-in for a token, and
 * omitting the rest keeps the contract small and its trust surface obvious.
 * @dev `_identity` is typed `address` rather than `IIdentity`. That is ABI-identical — Solidity
 * canonicalises contract types to `address` when computing selectors — so `registerIdentity` here
 * has exactly the same selector as ERC-3643's, without dragging in the ONCHAINID dependency.
