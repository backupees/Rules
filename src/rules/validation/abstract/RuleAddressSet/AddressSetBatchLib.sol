 * @title AddressSetBatchLib
 * @notice The batch add/remove loops shared by every address-list rule in this library.
 * @dev Extracted because the same two loops were written three times and had already drifted: only
 * the {RuleAddressSetInternal} copy was covered by a zero-address test (`CLAUDE_ANALYSIS.md` D-1).
 * Only the loops live here; single-address `add` / `remove` / `contains` / `length` stay as one-line
 * delegations to {EnumerableSet}, where a library would add indirection without removing duplication.
 *
 * @dev **The zero-address guard is a function-pointer parameter** so each rule keeps its own error
 * (`RuleAddressSet_ZeroAddressNotAllowed` vs `RuleERC2980_ZeroAddressNotAllowed`), per the
 * one-error-namespace-per-rule convention. Being a required parameter makes it MANDATORY: the call
 * does not compile without one. Returning a "zero found" flag instead would make the guard optional
 * in practice, and a caller that forgot it would list `address(0)` -- exactly what it prevents. The
 * pointer resolves at compile time and the library is `internal`, so this is a jump, not a
 * `DELEGATECALL`.
