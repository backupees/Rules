/**
 * @title BalanceCapManager
 * @notice Configuration of a per-address holding cap: which token to observe, what the cap is, which
 * addresses are exempt from it, and how much a given address may still receive.
 *
 * @dev Split out of `RuleMaxBalanceBase` so cap management is independent of two things it does not
 * need, matching {ChainlinkPoRFeedManager} and {TotalSupplyCapManager}:
 *
 * - **The constructor.** This contract declares none. It exposes the `_set*` internals plus the
 *   role-gated public setters, so an inheriting contract chooses when configuration happens: from a
 *   constructor (as `RuleMaxBalanceBase` does), from an initializer in an upgradeable deployment, or
 *   not at all until a setter is called.
 * - **ERC-1404.** Nothing here implements or depends on the restriction-code surface.
 *   {_capExceeded} answers in booleans and {_remainingCapacity} in token units; mapping an outcome to
 *   a restriction code, the code-to-message table and the `detectTransferRestriction*` /
 *   `transferred` entrypoints stay in the rule.
 *
 * The result is a reusable holding-cap component: a contract that merely wants a revert-free view of
 * how much an address may still receive can inherit this without acquiring an ERC-1404 surface it
 * would have to implement.
 *
 * @dev `maxBalance` has **no magic value**. `0` means non-exempt addresses may not hold any tokens;
 * it does not disable the cap.
 *
 * @dev IMPORTANT: {_balanceOf} must never revert, because the rule calls it from views that MUST NOT
 * revert. It is wrapped in `try/catch`, and a failure is reported as `available == false` for the
 * caller to map to its own restriction code. That relies on `balanceToken` still having code, which
 * the setter enforces at configuration time and EIP-6780 (Cancun) makes permanent -- a `try` to a
 * codeless address reverts *uncatchably*. This library targets Cancun or later (see `foundry.toml`).
 *
 * @dev The exemption list reuses {RuleAddressSetInternal}, the same `EnumerableSet` machinery as
 * `RuleWhitelist`, so the storage, the zero-address guard and the batch semantics are shared code
 * rather than a second implementation. Only the internal layer is inherited, so this contract
 * publishes one write API with exemption-specific names and events instead of two overlapping ones.
