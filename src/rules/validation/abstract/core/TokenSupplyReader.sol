 *
 * @dev Declares **no storage**: each rule keeps its own token variable and implements
 * {_supplyToken}. Holding it here would reorder every inheriting rule's slots for no benefit.
 *
 * @dev Only the `try/catch` probe is shared, not the validation. Each rule composes
 * {_probeTotalSupplyCallable} with its own `require`s so its three configuration failures keep three
 * distinct, named errors, per the one-error-namespace-per-rule convention.
 *
 * @dev **Deployment precondition.** {_currentSupply} performs no code-length check, because a `try`
 * to a codeless address reverts *uncatchably* -- the ABI decoder fails in this frame after the call
 * returns 0 bytes, out of `catch`'s reach (not `EXTCODESIZE`, which solc >= 0.8.10 skips when return
 * data is expected). Safety comes from configuration: each setter rejects a codeless candidate and
 * EIP-6780 makes that permanent. **Assumes a Cancun-or-later chain**; on an older one a validated
 * token could still become codeless and the ERC-1404 views would revert.
