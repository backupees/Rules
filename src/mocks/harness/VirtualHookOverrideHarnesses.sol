/**
 * @title VirtualHookOverrideHarnesses
 * @notice Proves that the `virtual` convention actually holds for functions that were previously
 *         non-`virtual` and therefore impossible to override (`CLAUDE_ANALYSIS.md` E-1, E-2, E-3).
 * @dev These contracts exist to be compiled: dropping `virtual` from any function they override
 *      makes the whole project fail to build, which is the only way a convention with no runtime
 *      behaviour can be regression-tested. The accompanying tests additionally check that the
 *      override is reached, so this is not merely a compile-time assertion.
 *
 *      For E-3 the coverage is deliberately REPRESENTATIVE, not exhaustive: one function is
 *      overridden per family (address-set write, ERC-2980 list write, rule configuration setter,
 *      approval write, token-facing `transferred` hook, binding). Overriding all 27 would add bulk
 *      without adding signal, because the compiler applies `virtual` per function, not per family --
 *      so a regression on an uncovered sibling would still slip through. That residual gap is the
 *      known cost of the sampling.
