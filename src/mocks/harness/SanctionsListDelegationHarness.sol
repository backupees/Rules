/**
 * @title SanctionsListExtraCheckHarness
 * @notice A subclass that adds a screening check which does NOT depend on the sanctions oracle
 *         (`CLAUDE_ANALYSIS.md` F-2).
 * @dev This is the shape that exposes the defect. `_detectTransferRestrictionFrom` used to nest its
 *      delegation to {_detectTransferRestriction} inside the `oracle != address(0)` branch, so with
 *      no oracle configured the `transferFrom` path returned `TRANSFER_OK` without ever calling the
 *      hook -- and this subclass's check silently did not apply there, while it did apply to a plain
 *      `transfer`. A compliance rule that screens one entrypoint and not the other is the failure
 *      this harness exists to catch.
