 * @title IIdentity — minimal stand-in for ONCHAINID's `IIdentity`.
 * @notice ERC-3643 imports `@onchain-id/solidity/contracts/interface/IIdentity.sol`. That package
 * is an npm dependency, not a git submodule, so it is not vendored here. This file supplies the
 * only member ERC-3643 actually *calls* — `keyHasPurpose`, in `Token.recoveryAddress` — and is
 * wired in through a context-scoped remapping that applies to `lib/ERC-3643/` only.
 *
 * @dev Same approach as `src/rules/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol`: redeclare the slice of a
 * third-party interface that is genuinely used rather than vendor the whole package. Everywhere
 * else in ERC-3643, `IIdentity` appears only as a parameter or event type, and a contract type
 * canonicalises to `address` in the ABI, so the declared members do not affect any selector.
 *
 * WARNING: this is NOT the real ONCHAINID interface. The genuine `IIdentity` extends ERC-734
 * (key management) and ERC-735 (claims) with a much larger surface. Do not treat this file as a
 * specification of ONCHAINID, and do not import it outside the ERC-3643 build context.
