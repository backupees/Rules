/**
 * @title DeployCMTATWithBlacklistSanctionsListAndMaxTotalSupply
 * @notice Deploys a CMTAT token behind a RuleEngine enforcing three validation rules: a blacklist,
 *         sanctions screening, and a hard cap on total supply.
 *
 *         Deployment order:
 *         1. `CMTATStandardStandalone` — the token (deployer as temporary admin, so it can be wired)
 *         2. `RuleBlacklist`           — blocks blacklisted sender / recipient / spender
 *         3. `RuleSanctionsList`       — blocks sanctioned addresses via a Chainalysis-style oracle
 *         4. `RuleMaxTotalSupply`      — rejects mints that would push `totalSupply` past the cap
 *         5. `RuleEngine`              — aggregates all three; the token is bound at construction
 *         6. `token.setRuleEngine(...)`
 *         7. Hand every admin role to `admin`, renounce the deployer's
 *
 * @dev **Step 4 must follow step 1.** Unlike the other two rules, `RuleMaxTotalSupply` validates its
 *      token at construction — non-zero, has code, and `totalSupply()` callable — so it cannot be
 *      deployed before the token exists. Passing a placeholder address reverts with
 *      `RuleMaxTotalSupply_TokenIsNotAContract`.
 *
 * @dev **One `RuleMaxTotalSupply` instance protects one token.** It reads `totalSupply()` from the
 *      `tokenContract` it was given, never from whichever token triggered the check, and behind a
 *      RuleEngine it cannot learn that identity. Do not add this instance to a second RuleEngine:
 *      both tokens would be capped against this one's supply. Deploy a second instance instead.
 *
 * @dev Rule order matters only for *which* restriction code a rejected transfer reports — the
 *      RuleEngine returns the first non-zero code — not for whether it is rejected. Blacklist first,
 *      then sanctions, then the supply cap, so an address-level rejection is reported in preference
 *      to a supply-level one.

     * @notice Deploys and wires the whole set.
     * @dev `deployer` is passed explicitly rather than read as `address(this)`, because the two
     *      execution contexts disagree about who makes the wiring calls: under `forge script` the
     *      broadcaster does, while a test calling {deploy} directly makes them from the script
     *      contract. Foundry also *rejects* `address(this)` inside a broadcast outright — "script
     *      contracts are ephemeral and their addresses should not be relied upon" — so a script that
     *      reads it works under test and reverts on the real deployment path.
     * @param admin Address that ends up holding every admin role.
     * @param deployer Address that executes the calls below and therefore holds the temporary admin
     *        roles: `msg.sender` under `forge script`, the script contract's address under test.
     * @param forwarder ERC-2771 trusted forwarder; `address(0)` disables meta-transactions.
     * @param sanctionsOracle Sanctions oracle; `address(0)` leaves screening disabled until
     *        `RuleSanctionsList.setSanctionListOracle` is called. **An unset oracle fails OPEN** —
     *        the rule passes every transfer.
     * @param maxTotalSupply The supply ceiling enforced on mints.
     * @return token The deployed CMTAT.
     * @return ruleEngine The engine holding the three rules.
     * @return ruleBlacklist The blacklist rule.
     * @return ruleSanctionsList The sanctions rule.
     * @return ruleMaxTotalSupply The supply-cap rule.
