/**
 * @title DeployCMTATWithBlacklistAndSanctionsList
 * @notice Deploys a CMTAT token behind a RuleEngine enforcing two validation rules: a blacklist and
 *         sanctions screening.
 *
 *         Deployment order:
 *         1. `CMTATStandardStandalone` — the token, with `deployer` as temporary admin
 *         2. `RuleBlacklist`           — blocks blacklisted sender / recipient / spender
 *         3. `RuleSanctionsList`       — blocks sanctioned addresses via a Chainalysis-style oracle
 *         4. `RuleEngine`              — aggregates both; the token is bound at construction
 *         5. `token.setRuleEngine(...)`
 *         6. Hand every admin role to `admin`, renounce the deployer's
 *
 * @dev **Topology A (RuleEngine).** Rules are reached through the engine, so inside a rule
 *      `msg.sender` is the RuleEngine rather than the token. See `CLAUDE.md`, "The two integration
 *      topologies", before adding an operation rule here.
 *
 * @dev Rule order affects only *which* restriction code a rejected transfer reports (the engine
 *      returns the first non-zero code), not whether it is rejected.
