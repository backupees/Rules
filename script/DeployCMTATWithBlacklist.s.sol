 * @title DeployCMTATWithBlacklist
 * @notice Deploys a CMTAT token guarded by a single `RuleBlacklist`.
 *
 *         Deployment order:
 *         1. `CMTATStandardStandalone` — the token, with `deployer` as temporary admin
 *         2. `RuleBlacklist`           — blocks blacklisted sender / recipient / spender
 *         3. `token.setRuleEngine(rule)`
 *         4. Hand `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to `admin`, renounce the deployer's
 *
 * @dev **Topology B (direct binding).** The rule is bound straight to the token, with no RuleEngine
 *      in between, so inside the rule `msg.sender` is the token itself. That is fine for a
 *      validation rule such as this one. It is *not* interchangeable with the RuleEngine topology
 *      for operation rules: see `CLAUDE.md`, "The two integration topologies". If you extend this
 *      script with a second rule you need a RuleEngine; start from
 *      `DeployCMTATWithBlacklistAndSanctionsList` instead.
